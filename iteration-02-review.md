## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
 * We use Trello to create tickets and delegate work to members, and to keep track of the tasks that need to be done and have to be done. This process turns out to be successful because everybody knows clearly about their reponsibility and other team members can also have an idea about the progress of other members so that they can make sure their work will not block other's work.

 * Weekly standups and code reviews, turn out to be successful. Weekly standups makes sure everybody is on the same page and our progress meets with our partner's requirements. Our partner provides us with important feedback about our approach so that we can modify our design in time.
 * Branching off and merging back with code reviews turn out to be successful as it avoids code conflicts when different team members are trying to push their code at the same time and every change in the main branch(merging) will not break anything that is already working.  
 * Plan ahead. Our team has tech lead(project manager) who is mainly responsible for assigning tasks, and making designs. Good designing and planning process ensures that we will always work on the correct direction and no duplicated or unnecessary code is written, which greatly improves our efficiency.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
