## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * We assumed our weekly meetings were more going to be each team member giving updates about what their progress/blockers in a structured manner. However, due to the nature of our project, we required the meetings more for planning out the details of our project than a standup. We did not expect the planning phase to be as challenging and take as much time as it did.
 * We also leaned towards setting soft deadlines rather than strict ones for the planning phase. The reasoning behind this decision was that we wanted everyone to have a chance to develop a good understanding of the project and have an adequate amount of time to come up with implementation ideas. As a consequence, the implementation phase had a tighter deadlines than what we would've liked.


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
