## `inject-secrets`

Command to inject 1Password secrets into a your Postman account (as variables in a Postman environment).

### Required Setup

To use this command, an integration with Postman API will be required. Please follow steps below:

- [Generate a Postman API Key](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/#generating-a-postman-api-key)
- Copy your Postman API Key and place it into your 1Password vault (in the credential field of an API Key item), for example:

**Optional Step**:
- For convenience, place the 1Password reference path to the Postman API Key in an environment variable named `POSTMAN_API_KEY_PATH`:

```
export POSTMAN_API_KEY_PATH=op://VAULT/ITEM-NAME
```

### Usage

Use the command as following: 

```
npm run inject-secrets -s op://<VAULT-NAME>/<POSTMAN-API-KEY-PATH> -e <POSTMAN-ENV-NAME> -r
```

#### Example
- Run the command 
  - *Note*: You can omit the `-s op://<VAULT-NAME>/<POSTMAN-API-KEY-PATH>` flag if you have completed the Optional Step in the Setup above
  - 1Password CLI will require authentication to access the secrets

```
> npm run inject-secrets -s op://test-postman-integration/postman-api-key -e 1password-secrets
